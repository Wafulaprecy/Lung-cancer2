# Lung Cancer Analysis & Detection

## Overview
This repository contains notebooks and datasets related to lung cancer analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) of lung cancer data, mortality trends, and lung cancer detection using CT scan images.

The project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Lung Cancer EDA & Mortality Analysis**: This section explores the available lung cancer datasets, performing EDA to identify trends and factors related to lung cancer incidence and mortality.
2. **Lung Cancer Detection using CT Scans**: This section focuses on applying machine learning techniques for detecting lung cancer from CT scan images.
